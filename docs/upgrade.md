# Upgrade

Once deployed you can upgrade to the latest version of Nuxtus by individually updating the associated components. You can find your current version of Nuxtus by looking in the `.version` file in the root of your project.

> Always remember to manually update the version number when you do manual updates so you know which version you are on.

## Nuxt update

Edit `client/package.json` and change `nuxt` version under `devDependencies` to the latest version then run `npm install`.

## Directus update

Edit `server/package.json` and change `directus` version under `dependencies` to the latest version then run:

```bash
npm install
npm run cli bootstrap
```
