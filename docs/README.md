# Getting Started

Nuxtus is an open-source boilerplate and suite of utilities to make working with [Directus](https://directus.io) and [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org) easy.

## Installation

If starting a new project it is recommended you use the Nuxtus boilerplate as this will set up everything for you. Existing projects can add Nuxtus to their project by following the [instructions below](#existing-project).

### New project

```bash
npx create-nuxtus app-name
```
Replace app-name with the name of your project.

> Nuxtus requires Node 16 (the minimum requirement for Directus).

### Existing project

1. [Install Directus Extention](directus-extension.md)
2. [Install Nuxt Module](nuxt-module.md)
