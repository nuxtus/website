# Getting started

Nuxtus can be used as a boilerplate to start a new project with Directus and Nuxt, or you can manually install the components that make up Nuxtus into your own project on an as needed basis.

## Installation

### New project

This is the easiest way to get up and running with Nuxtus. Assuming you have Node and npm installed on your computer simply run:

```bash
npx create-nuxtus project-name
```

> Nuxtus requires Node 16 (the minimum requirement for Diretus).
